Users can create an account, log into the account and sign back out. All data is stored in a mysql database.

## User Story

For someone to log in to "X", I want to know my personal details are safely stored so that I don't have to worry about using "X".

## Routes

API ROUTES - contains routes for signing in, logging out, and getting users data to be displayed client side 

HTML ROUTES - routes that check if user is signed in and already has account, sending them to the correct html page
